This is a sample application that interfaces with an autopilot. This application should open a connection to the autopilot device. This can be any type of connection (serial/socket). You could make use of the port\+\_\+lib library provided as part of this code base to establish serial or socket (UDP) communication. This app currently illustrates how one would open a port using the API provided in port\+\_\+lib. Make use of the messages provided by the scheduler to establish the rate at which you want functions to run. \begin{DoxySeeAlso}{See also}
