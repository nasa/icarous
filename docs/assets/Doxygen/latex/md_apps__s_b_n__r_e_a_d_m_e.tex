NASA Core Flight System (c\+FS) Software Bus Network (SBN) Application\hypertarget{md_apps__s_b_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md49}{}\doxysection{Description}\label{md_apps__s_b_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md49}
The SBN is a c\+FS application that is a plug in to the Core Flight Executive (c\+FE) component of the c\+FS.

The c\+FS is a platform and project independent reusable software framework and set of reusable applications developed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. This framework is used as the basis for the flight software for satellite data systems and instruments, but can be used on other embedded systems. More information on the c\+FS can be found at \href{http://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov}{\texttt{ http\+://cfs.\+gsfc.\+nasa.\+gov}}

The SBN application connects the c\+FE Software Bus (SB) to other buses, bridging the publish/subscribe messaging service to separate c\+FS instances in separate partitions, processes, processors, and/or networks.\hypertarget{md_apps__s_b_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md50}{}\doxysection{License}\label{md_apps__s_b_n__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md50}
