The goal of the guidance module is to provide outer loop controller to autopilot controllers and thus enable the aircraft to follow a flightplan, execute specific flight patterns such as loiter, hover, oribit, helix etc. Custom flight phase specific guidance implementation for takeoff and landing can also be provided.

Flight plan inputs are provided as a list of waypoints. These flight plans can simple linear plans. i.\+e. A sequence of waypoints. Flightplans can also involve Trajectory Change Points (TCP) that provide information about acceleration and deceleration segments. These flightplans with TCPs are referred to as kinematic plans. A simple linear plan can be converted into a kinematic plan. This conversion process is called repairing.

There are several modes of operation. Each mode is responsible for computing output commands for a specific flightplan or flight pattern. The output commands are heading angle, ground speed and vertical speed values that can be executed by a low-\/level autopilot controller.
