ICAROUS (Independent Configurable Architecture for Reliable Operations of Unmanned Systems) is a software architecture that enables the robust integration of mission specific software modules and highly assured core software modules for building safety-\/centric autonomous unmanned aircraft applications. The set of core software modules includes formally verified algorithms that detect, monitor, and control conformance to safety criteria; avoid stationary obstacles and maintain a safe distance from other users of the airspace; and compute resolution and recovery maneuvers, autonomously executed by the autopilot, when safety criteria are violated or about to be violated. ICAROUS is implemented using the NASA\textquotesingle{}s core Flight Systems (c\+FS) middleware. The aforementioned functionalities are implemented as c\+FS applications which interact via a publish/subscribe messaging service provided by the c\+FS Software Bus.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md22}{}\doxysubsubsection{User Guide}\label{index_autotoc_md22}
