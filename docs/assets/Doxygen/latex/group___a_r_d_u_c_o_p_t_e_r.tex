This application opens two ports, one port connects to the autopilot and the other connects to the ground station. The properties of these ports are defined in the input table. Mavlink packets received from the autopilot are redirected to the ground station and vice versa. Additionally, required information from incoming mavlink messages are extracted and published on to the c\+FS software bus so that other c\+FS applications can make use of them. Furthermore, this application also subscribes for commands to the autopilot issued by other c\+FS applications and converts them to appropriate mavlink messages and sends them to the autopilot. In addition to the autopilot\textquotesingle{}s telemetry that is being piped to the ground station, some Icarous related data (encoded as mavlink messages) is also sent to the ground station. Reading data from the autopilot and groundstation are each on separate threads. The rate at which each thread executes is controlled by the c\+FS scheduler.
