ICAROUS provides an application to communicate using Open\+Splice DDS. Enable this application as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Download and install an Open\+Splice DDS 32bit version
\item Create an Open\+Splice configuration file (.xml) with {\bfseries{domain id}} 100. Follow the examples provided in the Open\+Splice DDS distribution directory within {\ttfamily etc/conf}.
\item Add {\ttfamily dds\+\_\+interface} to the {\ttfamily TGT1\+\_\+\+APPLIST} in the file {\ttfamily c\+FS/apps/\+Icarous\+\_\+defs/targets.\+cmake} to compile the dds application\+:
\item Define the following environment variable for building\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily OSPL\+\_\+\+HOME}\+: the path of the Open\+Splice local installation; for example, {\ttfamily /opt/\+Open\+Splice/\+HDE/x86.linux}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Define the following environment variables before executing ICAROUS\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily OSPL\+\_\+\+URI}\+: the URI of the Open\+Splice {\ttfamily $\ast$.xml} configuration file for {\bfseries{domain id}} 100 (the one of {\itshape Step 2}); for example, {\ttfamily \href{file:///opt/OpenSplice/HDE/x86.linux/etc/icarous-ospl.xml}{\texttt{ file\+:///opt/\+Open\+Splice/\+HDE/x86.\+linux/etc/icarous-\/ospl.\+xml}}} (note the three initial slashes)
\item {\ttfamily OSPL\+\_\+\+HOME}\+: the path of the Open\+Splice local installation; for example, {\ttfamily /opt/\+Open\+Splice/\+HDE/x86.linux}
\item {\ttfamily LD\+\_\+\+LIBRARY\+\_\+\+PATH}\+: it has to include the library path of the Open\+Splice local installation in order for ICAROUS to find them; for example, {\ttfamily /opt/\+Open\+Splice/\+HDE/x86.linux/lib}
\end{DoxyItemize}

An example command could look like this\+:
\end{DoxyEnumerate}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{OSPL\_URI="{}file:///opt/OpenSplice/HDE/x86.linux/etc/icarous-\/ospl.xml"{} \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{OSPL\_HOME="{}/opt/OpenSplice/HDE/x86.linux"{} \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH="{}\$\{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH\}:/opt/OpenSplice/HDE/x86.linux/lib"{} \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo ./core-\/cpu1}

\end{DoxyCode}
