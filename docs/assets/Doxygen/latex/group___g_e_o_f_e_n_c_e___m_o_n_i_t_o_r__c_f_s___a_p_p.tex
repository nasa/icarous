This application provides geofence monitoring servies. Both keep-\/in and keep-\/out constraint violations are monitored. This application listens to the ICAROUS\+\_\+\+GEOFENCE\+\_\+\+MID topic for \mbox{\hyperlink{structgeofence__t}{geofence\+\_\+t}} messages encoding geofence information. It publishes output on the ICAROUS\+\_\+\+GEOFENCE\+\_\+\+MONITOR\+\_\+\+MID. Additionally, it also checks if each mission waypoint satisfies all geofence constraints. It also checks if the direct path from a given position to the next waypoint is free from geofence conflicts.
