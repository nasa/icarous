<pre>public final class <span class="typeNameLabel">Units</span>
extends java.lang.Object</pre>
<div class="block">This class defines the conversion factors for various units. Base units are
 defined for the seven base dimensions: length, mass, time, electric current,
 thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity.
 Together these seven units form a coherent set of units. If all quantities in
 a program are defined in terms of these seven coherent units, then no unit
 conversions are required within the program. Unit conversions are only needed
 when specifying and outputting quantities. This class is designed to
 facilitate that type of use.
 <p>
 
 For example:
 <p>
 
 <pre>
 // Specifying Quantities
 double one_mile = Units.from(&quot;mi&quot;, 1.0);
 double one_km = Units.from(&quot;km&quot;, 1.0);
 double time = Units.from(&quot;hour&quot;, 1.0);
 
 // &quot;The Program&quot; (note, there are no unit conversions)
 double distance = one_mile + one_km;
 double speed = distance / time;
 
 // Outputting Quantities
 // should be about 2.6:
 System.out.println(&quot;The distance in kilometers is &quot; + Units.to(&quot;km&quot;, distance)); 
 // should be about 1.6:
 System.out.println(&quot;The distance in miles is &quot; + Units.to(&quot;mi&quot;, distance)); 
 // should be about 8560:
 System.out.println(&quot;The distance in feet is &quot; + Units.to(&quot;ft&quot;, distance)); 
 // should be about 1.6
 System.out.println(&quot;The speed in miles/hour is &quot; + Units.to(&quot;mph&quot;, speed)); 
 // should be about 0.72
 System.out.println(&quot;The speed in m/s is &quot; + Units.to(&quot;m/s&quot;, speed)); 
 </pre>
 <p>
 
 One important consideration when using the Units class is that the Units
 class performs <b>NO</b> consistency checks. The Units class trusts that the
 user will use units with a consistent dimension. This was a deliberate design
 decision because of the performance penalty associated with checking
 consistency. An example of this inconsistency is:
 <p>
 
 <pre>
 double one_mile = Units.from(&quot;mile&quot;, 1.0);
 System.out.println(&quot;One mile in liters is &quot; + Units.to(&quot;liter&quot;, one_mile));
 </pre>
 
 Obviously this makes no sense, but the Units class will not flag this as an
 error; be careful.
 <p>
 
 One can determine if two units are compatible by using the
 <a href="../../../../gov/nasa/larcfm/Util/Units.html#isCompatible-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-"><code>isCompatible(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)</code></a> method. Units are considered compatible if they have
 the same dimensionality. For instance, the unit "meter" is compatible with
 the unit "foot" since they are both units of distance.
 <p>
 
 <pre>
 if (!isCompatible(&quot;m&quot;, &quot;L&quot;)) {
        System.out.println(&quot;'m' and 'L' are not compatible units!&quot;);
 }
 if (isCompatible(&quot;ft&quot;, &quot;m&quot;)) {
        System.out.println(&quot;'ft' and 'm' are compatible units!&quot;);
 }
 </pre>
 <p>
 
 One can always correctly convert between compatible units. The unit
 "unspecified" is a special unit that is compatible with all units. To get the
 list of units compatible with a given unit use the
 <a href="../../../../gov/nasa/larcfm/Util/Units.html#getCompatibleUnits-java.lang.String-"><code>getCompatibleUnits(java.lang.String)</code></a> method.
 <p>
 
 The user can also create their own composite units with the
 <a href="../../../../gov/nasa/larcfm/Util/Units.html#addUnit-java.lang.String-double-java.lang.String-"><code>addUnit(String, double, String)</code></a> method. For example a <i>fathom</i>
 unit could be defined as:
 <p>
 <tt>Units.addUnit("fathom", 6.0, "foot"); </tt>
 <p>
 This method means, define the unit called "fathom", where one fathom is equal
 to 6.0 feet. This method also states that the new "fathom" unit is compatible
 with the unit of "foot."
 
 To create a new composite unit that has no compatible units, use the
 <a href="../../../../gov/nasa/larcfm/Util/Units.html#addUnit-java.lang.String-double-"><code>addUnit(String, double)</code></a> method. For example a <i>linear density</i>
 unit could be defined as:
 <p>
 <tt>Units.addUnit("kg/m", Units.kg / Units.meter);</tt>
 <p>
 
 Usage Notes:
 <p>
 
 <ul>
 <li>An alternate way to use the units class is to use constant factors
 instead of string representations. For example:
 <p>
 
 <pre>
 // Specifying Quantities
 double one_mile = Units.from(Units.mile, 1.0);
 double one_km = Units.from(Units.kilometer, 1.0);
 double time = Units.from(Units.hour, 1.0);
 </pre>
 
 The advantage of this approach is that it is slightly more efficient since a
 lookup of the string value does not need to be performed. Since this
 operation only occurs when values are input, it is questionable how much time
 is really saved.
 
 <li>The above examples (using either strings or factors) are the preferred
 use of the Units class; however, this notation can become
 cumbersome--especially when specifying values inside code. An alternate use of
 the Units class is to multiply by the conversion factor when specifying
 constants. For example:
 <p>
 
 <pre>
 double one_mile = 1.0 * Units.mile;
 System.out.println(&quot;One mile in kilometers is &quot; + Units.to(&quot;km&quot;, one_mile));
 </pre>
 
 <p>
 
 The "to" and "from" methods are preferred, because some conversions are not
 simply multiplying a factor, but involve an offset also. Those that involve an
 offset (currently only degreeC and degreeF), must use the "to" and "from"
 methods. Forms such as <tt>double temp = 32.0 * degreeF;</tt> are
 <i>always</i> wrong.
 
 <li>The Units class does not define a "pound". The problem is that in most
 official standards documents, a pound is a unit of mass; however, in most
 science and engineering texts, a pound is a unit of force. We avoid the
 problem by not defining a pound at all, and instead defining a pound_mass
 (lbm) and a pound_force (lbf).
 <p>
 
 <li>There are many more units defined as strings in the Units class than the
 number defined as class fields in the Units class. To get a complete list of
 all units defined as a strings call the <a href="../../../../gov/nasa/larcfm/Util/Units.html#getAllUnits--"><code>getAllUnits()</code></a> method.
 <p>
 
 <li>The internal unit for angles is always radians. The SI convention is
 followed by calling this a dimensionless derived unit, defined as m / m.
 <p>
 
 Since angles are always represented in radians, a user of the Units class
 does not need to perform unit conversions to get radians for trigonometric
 functions. Expressions like
 <p>
 <tt>a = Math.cos(Units.from("radian", pi_over_2));</tt>
 <p>
 are not necessary, but are still valid. Expressions that use degrees still
 need units specified, for example:
 <p>
 <tt>double right_angle = Units.from("degree", 90.0);</tt><br>
 <tt>a = Math.cos(right_angle);</tt>
 <p>
 
 <li>The units for thermodynamic temperature are degreeC, degreeF, K,
 and degreeR, representing Celsius, Farenheit, Kelvin, and Rankin.
 <p>
 
 <li>SI defines the unit of frequency as the reciprocal second and gives this
 quantity the name <i>hertz</i> and the symbol <i>Hz</i>. The Units class
 defines these quantities as "hertz" and "Hz". Some disciplines use the term
 <i>frequency</i> to indicate an angular velocity. Specifically, the notion in
 dynamic systems of <i>natural frequency</i>, often abbreviated with the Greek
 symbol lower-case omega (&#969;), is actually an angular velocity. In the
 Units class, the appropriate symbol for angular velocity is
 "radian_per_second" or "degree_per_second". However, since quantities like
 <i>natural frequency</i> have frequency in their name, they are often,
 incorrectly, expressed in "hertz." To accomodate this type of usage, the
 Units class defines a unit "hertzAngular". "hertz" and "hertzAngular" are
 <b>NOT</b> compatible with each other, the first is a frequency and the
 second is an angular velocity.
 <p>
 
 <li>Both joules and newton-meters are defined. These units are so similar
 that they could be considered the same. They are kept separate because joules
 are used to represent energy and newton-meters are used to represent torque.
 Energy is a scalar quantity and torque is a vector. It is rare that they are
 interchanged. The US Customary unit for energy is the foot-pound (ft-lbf),
 and the unit for torque is the pound-foot (lbf-ft). This last name is our
 invention.
 <p>
 
 <li>Both names <i>metre</i> and <i>meter</i> and <i>litre</i> and
 <i>liter</i> are defined. Each pair is identical. In the approved English
 language version of the SI standard, only the terms "metre" and "litre" are
 defined. However, in the US version of this document, prepared by the
 National Institute of Standards and Technology (Special Pub. 330) using
 current US government policy, the only defined terms are "meter" and "liter."
 The Units class defines both; however, the reader will observe a bias in the
 documentation in favor of the US terms.
 </ul>
 
 
 Special Constants:
 <p>
 
 <ul>
 <li>The Units class defines <i>gn</i> as the adopted physical constant of
 gravity. It is given (out of place) in the Units class, due to the fact that
 the definition of the fundamental US customary unit of mass (slug) depends on
 this quantity.
 <p>
 
 This quantity, Units.gn, is defined in IEEE/ASTM SI 10-1997 as (exactly)
 9.80665 m/s^2 [page 25]. The 1962 U.S. Standard Atmosphere [page 4] calls
 this quantity "standard sea-level gravity" and describes it as the
 acceleration due to the combined effects of gravity and the Earth's rotation
 (i.e. the centrifugal relief) at geodetic latitude 45 degrees. This constant
 was adopted in the US in 1935.
 <p>
 
 The latitude of 45 degrees was chosen because this is the standard latitude
 chosen by the World Meteorological Organization to calibrate barometers. As a
 note, this value is the solution to Lambert's equation (sea-level gravity as
 a function of latitude), when the latitude is 45 degrees 32 minutes and 33
 seconds.
 
 <li>The Units class defines Units.P0 as the adopted physical constant of
 standard atmosphere. This quantity equals 101325 Pa. This definition is added
 to the Units class because the definition of an atmosphere unit ("atm")
 depends on it. This definition comes from NIST Special Publication 330, the
 International System of Units (SI), 1991 edition, p15.
 </ul>
 
 Implementation Notes:
 <p>
 
 <ul>
 <li>The Units class uses the SI system (with base units: meter [distance],
 kilogram [mass], second [time interval], ampere [electric current], kelvin
 [thermodynamic temperature], mole [amount of substance], and candela
 [luminous intensity]) as a coherent set of base units (internal units).
 <p>
 
 Please remember the user of the Units class should never <i>need</i> to know
 how the variables are stored internally. The user need only remember to
 specifically state the units on input and output and any conversions will
 occur automatically.
 <p>
 
 <li>The purpose of this class is geared to modeling large engineered systems
 such as airplanes. As such, many units useful in other disciplines are not
 defined (such as the "carat" or a "bushel"). However, they may be defined in
 future versions of this class.
 <p>
 
 Please note that since the complete set of seven base units are defined, any
 other units needed may be defined by the user with the <a href="../../../../gov/nasa/larcfm/Util/Units.html#addUnit-java.lang.String-double-"><code>addUnit()</code></a> method.
 <p>
 
 <li>Much care was used in defining each of these conversion factors. The full
 precision from appropriate standards documents was used. However, some units
 are defined as the arithmetic relationship between 'more fundamental'
 quantities. In these cases, the conversion factors are limited to the resolution
 of double precision operations. For most engineering purposes
 (see the point above) this is more than good enough; however, someone working
 with very precise quantities (> 12 significant digits), should be aware of
 the possibility of differences.
 <p>
 
 <li>The names of many of the conversion factors violate standard naming
 conventions for class variables. This was deemed acceptable since these names
 follow the standard capitalization conventions from SI or other standards
 bodies.
 <p>
 
 <li>The Units class is not <i>immutable</i>. However modification of this
 class is limited. Specifically, there is no mechanism to "delete" a unit from
 the Units class, nor is there any ability to "change" a conversion factor of
 a unit. These restrictions allow the user to be confident that once a unit is
 in the Units class, its definition will never change. The unit "A" will
 always be an ampere, it will never become an angstrom.

<div class="block">gn is the adopted physical constant of gravity. It is given (out of
 place) here, due to the fact that the definition of the fundamental US
 customary units of mass (slug and pound-mass) depend on this quantity.
 <p>
 
 This quantity, Units.gn, is defined in IEEE/ASTM SI 10-1997 as (exactly)
 9.80665 m/s^2 [page 25]. The 1962 U.S. Standard Atmosphere [page 4] calls
 this quantity "standard sea-level gravity" and describes it as the
 acceleration due to the combined effects of gravity and the Earth's
 rotation (i.e. the centrifugal relief) at geodetic latitude 45 degrees.
 This constant was adopted long before 1962.
 <p>
 
 This definition is also in NIST Special Publication 330, the
 International System of Units (SI), 1991 edition, p17.

 This method is primarily used as a performance enhancement (and so it
 should be used carefully, and when in doubt, not at all). The idea is if
 one wants to convert several values of the same unit instead of
 converting each individually (and incuring the string->value lookup
 penality each time), perform the string lookup once (using this method),
 then convert each value with the factor.
 <p>
 
 Unexpected behavior may result if the unit is "degreeC" or "degreeF".
