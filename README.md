Independent Configurable Architecture for Reliable Operations of Unmanned Systems (ICAROUS)
========

ICAROUS (Independent Configurable Architecture for Reliable Operations of
Unmanned Systems) is a software architecture that enables the robust integration
of mission specific software modules and highly assured core software
modules for building safety-centric autonomous unmanned aircraft
applications. The set of core software modules includes formally
verified algorithms that detect, monitor, and control conformance
to safety criteria; avoid stationary obstacles and maintain a safe
distance from other users of the airspace; and compute resolution
and recovery maneuvers, autonomously executed by the autopilot, when
safety criteria are violated or about to be violated. ICAROUS is implemented using the
NASA's core Flight Systems (cFS) middleware. The aforementioned functionalities are implemented as
cFS applications which interact via a publish/subscribe messaging
service provided by the cFS Software Bus.

### Detect and Avoid (DAA) and Geofencing Capabilities

ICAROUS integrates NASA's open source software packages [DAIDALUS](http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm/DAIDALUS)
(Detect and Avoid Alerting Logic for Unmanned Systems) and
[PolyCARP](http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm/PolyCARP) (Algorithms and Software
for Computations with Polygons). DAIDALUS provides detect and avoid
capabilities, while PolyCARP provides geofencing capabilities.
